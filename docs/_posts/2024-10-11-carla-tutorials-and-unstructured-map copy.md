# Custom unstructured map

To create a custom map, I duplicated the BaseMap provided by CARLA. This empty map offers a sky as a starting point. I then crafted a *landscape* in the Unreal editor, adding foliage, rocks, and other elements using CARLA's materials. Once complete, you can launch the simulation and spawn a controllable car and camera. However, this process doesn't generate a road layout or waypoints, and lacks traffic management, spawn points, or autopilot functionality. You can see the result in the video below:

# Create map using OpenStreetMap

Thanks to <https://www.openstreetmap.org/>, you can download a `.osm` file containing all road information and easily convert it to .xodr format (OpenDRIVE) using one of CARLA's provided scripts (`PythonAPI/util/osm_to_xodr.py`). After launching CARLA and starting a simulation, you can dynamically set the OpenStreetMap using the command `python config.py -x /path/to/map.xodr`. The resulting map is fully navigableâ€”autopilot, spawn points, and other features work perfectly. You can see an example in the video below:
