This document serves as supplementary material for installing CARLA from source. While not a step-by-step guide, it details my personal experience during the installation process, highlighting common issues and their workarounds.

ðŸ“˜ [Guide for building CARLA from source (required for development)](https://carla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_linux/)

## Prerequisites

System requirements:

- Ubuntu 18.04
- 130 GB disk space
- 8GB dedicated GPU (recommended)

My system:

- Ubuntu 22.04.4
- 611 GB disk space
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti (11GB)
- AMD Ryzen 7 2700 Eight-Core Processor
- 32GB RAM

### Software requirements
The software requirements installation process went smoothly.

To clone CARLA's Unreal fork, I followed the process outlined at [https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/ue4-on-github).

The Unreal Engine 4.26 build was successful, taking approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Here's a screenshot of the Unreal editor to confirm the installation:

It's worth noting that compiling all the required shaders to create a new project from a template took considerable time. The process even stalled once, requiring a restart. On the second attempt, it ran smoothly and opened up within seconds.

## Build CARLA

After cloning CARLA, I switched to the master branch. According to the documentation:

>The `master` branch contains the current release of CARLA with the latest fixes and features.

In this case, it's version 0.9.15.

### Compile Python API client
While attempting to compile the Python API client, I encountered the following error:

```bash
Setup.sh: Extracting boost for Python 3.
Building B2 engine..

A C++11 capable compiler is required for building the B2 engine.
Toolset 'clang' does not appear to support C++11.

> clang++ -x c++ -std=c++11  check_cxx11.cpp
check_cxx11.cpp:14:10: fatal error: 'thread' file not found
#include <thread>
         ^~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

** Note, the C++11 capable compiler is _only_ required for building the B2
** engine. The B2 build system allows for using any C++ level and any other
** supported language and resource in your projects.

You can specify the toolset as the argument, i.e.:
    ./build.sh [options] gcc

Toolsets supported by this script are:
    acc, clang, como, gcc, intel-darwin, intel-linux, kcc, kylix, mipspro,
    pathscale, pgi, qcc, sun, sunpro, tru64cxx, vacpp

For any toolset you can override the path to the compiler with the '--cxx'
option. You can also use additional flags for the compiler with the
'--cxxflags' option.

A special toolset; cxx, is available which is used as a fallback when a more
specific toolset is not found and the cxx command is detected. The 'cxx'
toolset will use the '--cxx' and '--cxxflags' options, if present.

Options:
    --help                  Show this help message.
    --verbose               Show messages about what this script is doing.
    --debug                 Build b2 with debug information, and no
                            optimizations.
    --guess-toolset         Print the toolset we can detect for building.
    --cxx=CXX               The compiler exec to use instead of the detected
                            compiler exec.
    --cxxflags=CXXFLAGS     The compiler flags to use in addition to the
                            flags for the detected compiler.

Failed to build B2 build engine
make: *** [Util/BuildTools/Linux.mk:142: setup] Error 1
```

Apparently, this is a well-known issue (<https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/6901>). Installing the g++ 12 compiler and recompiling solved the problem.

```bash
sudo apt install g++-12
make PythonAPI
```

Remember to restart your terminal or source your `.bashrc` file after setting the `UE4_ROOT` variable and before compiling the API. Failing to do so may result in the following error:

```bash
CMake Error at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/CMakeDetermineCCompiler.cmake:49 (message):

```

To install the CARLA client in a virtual environment, you can use the `.whl` file generated during the compilation process. In my case, the generated wheel file is located at:

`PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.15-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl`

As you can see, it's been generated for Python 3.10. While it works for me, I'm unsure why only this version was generated. Here's an installation example:

```bash
dpascualhe@dpascualhe:~/repos/carla$ python3.10 -m venv ~/.venvs/carla
dpascualhe@dpascualhe:~/repos/carla$ source ~/.venvs/carla/bin/activate
(carla) dpascualhe@dpascualhe-optical:~/repos/carla$ pip install PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.15-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
Processing ./PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.15-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
Installing collected packages: carla
Successfully installed carla-0.9.15
```

### Compile the server
Server compilation (`make launch`) is very time-consuming due to the extensive shader compilation required. The process crashed multiple times, requiring repeated attempts. Eventually, I succeeded in compiling and launching the Unreal Engine editor. Below is a screenshot displaying the `Town10 HD` scenario:

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/unreal_carla.png" alt="">

It's important to note that even after the editor launches, shaders and mesh distance fields continue compiling for some time.

To verify that graphical acceleration was working correctly, I ran `nvidia-smi`. The `UE4Editor` process was consuming approximately 4-5GB of my GPU's VRAM.

### Start the simulation
Once the editor launched and all shaders and mesh distance fields were ready, I attempted to run the simulation. However, when I pressed the `PLAY` button, the editor crashed. I discovered that my swap partition was too small for CARLA (<https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/issues/3398>). After increasing my swap size to 8GB, everything ran smoothly (this likely would have prevented some earlier issues as well). This requirement was surprising, given that I have 32GB of RAM.

With the simulation running, I tested the Python client examples suggested in the documentation. While installing the Python requirements, I encountered an issue with the requested `numpy` version. The installation failed with this error message:

```bash

```

Apparently, recent changes related to `setuptools` are causing this issue (<https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/27405>). None of the suggested workarounds were successful for me, so I opted for a simple solution: I removed the exact version match from the `requirements.txt` file and ran `pip install` after activating my `carla` virtual environment. Here's my modified requirements file:

```
future
numpy
pygame
matplotlib
open3d
Pillow
```

Both the `generate_traffic.py` and `dynamic_weather.py` scripts ran flawlessly. However, I'll keep an eye on potential issues that might arise from the installed numpy version. Here's a screenshot of a running simulation:
